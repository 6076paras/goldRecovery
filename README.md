## **Gold Purification Process**

Gold purification is a multi-stage process used to extract pure gold from ore, focusing on flotation and leaching stages.

### 1. **Flotation Process (First Stage)**

Flotation separates gold from gangue based on surface properties. Gold becomes hydrophobic, attaching to air bubbles and floating to the surface, while gangue stays submerged.

#### Flotation Steps:
- Ore is crushed and mixed with water to form a slurry.
- Flotation chemicals are added to separate gold from gangue.
- Air bubbles cause gold to float, forming a froth, which is skimmed off as **rougher concentrate**.
- Remaining material, **rougher tails**, has a lower gold concentration and is either discarded or further treated.

### 2. **First Stage of Leaching (Cyanidation)**

Cyanidation uses cyanide to dissolve gold from the concentrate into a gold-cyanide complex.

#### Cyanidation Steps:
- Flotation concentrate is mixed with sodium cyanide.
- Cyanide leaches gold into a liquid form, separating it from gangue.

### 3. **Second Stage of Leaching (Activated Carbon or Zinc Precipitation)**

Gold is recovered from the cyanide solution using activated carbon or zinc.

#### Activated Carbon Adsorption:
- Cyanide solution is passed through activated carbon, adsorbing gold.
- Gold is stripped from the carbon and refined.

#### Zinc Precipitation:
- Zinc is added to the cyanide solution, causing gold to precipitate.
- Gold is filtered out and refined.
